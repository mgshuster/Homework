• All language is, at best, Metaphor, except it's nothing like that
• Zen and language (and other forms of media) do not mix; to be less specific, Zen recognizes that language is too limited for what may be called Truth
• The attainment of Zen could be described as "seeing," or not
• Since language is limited, explaining Zen is a futile effort...and so is this assignment
• Forget everything I just said about Zen, It will bias you with Translation Errors
