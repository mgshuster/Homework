Course Goals Project - Actual

1  •Show genuine concern for the feelings and thoughts of others and seek to act on that 	concern (service learning)
2  •Apply basic communication skills (eye contact, body language, etc)
3  •Display appreciation for differing opinions by exhibiting respect for others' 		viewpoints
4  •Seek to understand others' views
5  •Present own views in an appropriate manner
6  •Contribute positively to classroom discussions and projects
7  •Connects and applies past knowledge to new learning
8  •Asks questions about information presented and carefully examines different ways of 	thinking

3  •Display appreciation for differing opinions by exhibiting respect for others' 		viewpoints
	There's a good philosophy (of the type taught by mothers and other wise (wo)men,
not of type used by Lucy of Peanuts) that prescribes the second best way to comply with this Goal (the first will come in the next paragraph): "Don't talk about politics or religion with your friends or family, else they won't be for very long." Unless you are very PC and/or you know, not think but actually know, that you know what you're talking about, be very careful who you talk with about controversial or subjective topics.

4•  Seek to understand others' views:
	This is the best way to follow Goal 3, and is well summed up by a piece of advice commonly found on /b/: "Lurk Moar." It means that the advise-ed should lurk, or watch without interfering or participating, moar (a bastardization of the word more) before they try to participate in whatever happens to be going on, typically because they do not have enough understanding about what is going on and/or what the dynamics of the conversation are to be able to participate without acting like a t0ta1 n00b. Applied to the real world or more generally, it can mean that the advise-ed should: try to understand what others consider important, "where they are coming from," what they see as they see it, their reasons for doing something, their thought process, and how they come to their conclusions before they make a fool or bigot of themselves.
