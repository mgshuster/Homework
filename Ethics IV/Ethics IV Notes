4 Nable Truths:
1. life is suffering - "typically lived in an unfulfilling way and filled with insecurity"
2. "life's dislocation is cause by...the desire for private fulfillment"
3. "cure of selfish craving is the overcoming of such craving"
4. the way to overcome is the Eightfold Path

"The Eightfold path is a course of treatment - treatment by training"
Preliminary - Right association
