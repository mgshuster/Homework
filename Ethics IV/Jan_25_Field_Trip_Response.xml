   <para/>
   <para>You are assigned to write a 1-2 page response for each field trip this semester. A well written response goes beyond summarizing the itinerary. In the written response, you are expected to give insights, ask questions, provide comments, and describe your reaction to the experience. In keeping with the goals for this course, it is not your purpose to judge or write about whether or not you agree with the world view being presented; this is not an opinion paper. You may include your thoughts about information and ideas presented in a professional manner. You may also wish to make connections to information you've gathered from reading for this course, other courses, books you've read, movies you've seen, or other cultural experiences you've had.</para>
