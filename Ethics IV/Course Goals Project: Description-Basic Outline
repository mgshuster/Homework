#Question past knowledge in order to weed out inaccuracies
#It's better to figure out yourself that you are wrong than to have a troll do it for you
#You aren't an expert
#The Internet is always right

#I'm going to draw an example of a troll's argument that will show how it can positively #contribute to a conversation and can teach a person, like: Everything you know is wrong #or assumed, and thus even more wrong; Never use anything in an argument and assume it's #wrong unless/until you can prove it, to prove it, you have to impartially re-examine and #question everything, once all the assumptions are minimized and the incorrect things are #fixed, it will look nothing like when it started, therefore, you were still wrong; don't #treat opinions/experience/statistics as facts, and don't dismiss facts as opinions/#experience/statistics; and your opinions/views are always the minority.

Probably the biggest reason for why I could not get this Project done is because the Course Goals are so cryptic. As an alternative assignment, I'm going to rewrite the Course Goals so that they are human-readable. Since this project is worth a lot of points, I'm going to rewrite them with a paragraph per goal, as requested by Ms. Peach.
