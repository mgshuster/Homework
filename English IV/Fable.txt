During the summer, the moles of a forest made a fortress with high walls of dirt. They proclaimed that their fortress was invincible since no animals could
penetrate their walls and they patrolled the tunnels underneath. As winter
approached, they gathered all their food in the center of the fortress, the
safest place they knew of. When the first rain of winter came, the fortress
dissolved and exposed its interior. The entire forest, seeing this great pile
of food, then raided the dissolved fortress and took every last scrap.

Moral: 
	Never underestimate your weaknesses and always have a backup plan: You
are never invincible.
