	Disillusionment is the "I am disappoint" that results when one disregards the advice of "Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain," when one discovers that the grass is not greener on the other side, or when one wakes up from their enchantment.

	A person feels disillusionment from discovering the inner workings of something or what's beyond the veil and it being less than what they had imagined it to be. Disillusionment often leads to anger from feeling cheated and is typically preceded by or mixed with a feeling of surprise from discovering that it is different at all. In Araby, the character gets disillusioned by time, seeing that things don't always work out well and that the simplest of things, like perhaps his uncle going to the pub for a drink, can cause ruin to even "the best laid plans of mice and men."
	I am no stranger to having plans ruined by time, mostly because I get my sense of time from my mother. We've suddenly remembered events and appointments once they're halfway over or even the day after.
